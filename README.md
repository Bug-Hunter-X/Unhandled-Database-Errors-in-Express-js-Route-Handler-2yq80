# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers that interact with databases.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data; however, it lacks proper error handling for database failures.  This can lead to server crashes or inconsistent responses to clients.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring a more robust and reliable application.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version). 
4.  Try accessing a non-existent user ID, observe the server response or lack thereof in the `bug.js` and compare it to the response in `bugSolution.js`

## Solution

The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling within the route handler.  This includes catching database errors, logging them appropriately, and sending appropriate HTTP error responses to the client.
